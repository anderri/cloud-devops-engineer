# Encode & Decode

Encoding and decoding are used in many forms of communications, including computing, data communications, programming, digital electronics and human communications.&#x20;

These two processes involve changing the format of content for optimal transmission or storage. In computers, encoding is the process of putting a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, and certain symbols) into a specialized format for efficient transmission or storage. Decoding is the opposite process -- the conversion of an encoded format back into the original sequence of characters.&#x20;

These terms should not be confused with encryption and decryption, which focus on hiding and securing data. (We can encrypt data without changing the code or encode data without deliberately concealing the content.)
